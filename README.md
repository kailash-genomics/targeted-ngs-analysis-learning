# End-to-End Targeted NGS Panel Analysis (Learning Project)

## Overview
This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of a targeted DNA sequencing data analysis pipeline, starting from raw FASTQ files to annotated variants.

## Disclaimer
This repository is intended for educational and skill-development purposes only.  
The pipeline and scripts demonstrated here are not validated for clinical diagnostics and should not be used for patient-related decision making.

## Dataset

This project is based on publicly available human targeted sequencing datasets used for training and learning purposes.

- Sequencing type: Targeted DNA sequencing (gene panel)
- Data format: Paired-end FASTQ
- Analysis type: Tumor-only somatic variant analysis
- Reference genome: hg19 / GRCh38
- Target regions: Cancer-related genes defined by a BED file

Raw sequencing data files are not included in this repository due to size and privacy considerations.
